//What if I wanted to make a tip calculator here in JS? 

//So, let's outline what it needs to do:
    // 1. Take in the amount for a meal 
    // 2. Calculate sales tax on that meal and then apply that. 
    // 3. Ask the user if they want to do a 10%, 15%, or 20% tip on top of that 
    // 4. Spit out a nice message that thanks the users and says how much they will be paying in total

//So, what do I need to do in order to address each problem? 

//first things first, let's read some user input. 
let orderCost = window.prompt("How much did your meal cost?"); //this will prompt the user for a total
